# [Laminate](http://getskeleton.com)
Laminate is a simple, responsive boilerplate to kickstart any responsive project.

Check out <http://getskeleton.com> for documentation and details.

## Getting started

There are a couple ways to download Skeleton:
- [Download the zip](https://github.com/mendoncagary/Laminate/releases/download/2.0.4/Skeleton-2.0.4.zip)
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/mendoncagary/Laminate.git` (Note: this is under active development, so if you're looking for stable and safe, use the zipped download)


### What's in the download?

The download includes Laminate's CSS, Normalize CSS as a reset, a sample favicon, and an index.html as a starting point.

```
Laminate/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   ├── normalize.min.css
│   └── skeleton.css
└── images/
    └── favicon.ico

```

### Why it's awesome

Laminate is lightweight and simple. It styles only raw HTML elements (with a few exceptions) and provides a responsive grid. Nothing more.
- Around 400 lines of CSS unminified and with comments
- It's a starting point, not a UI framework
- No compiling or installing...just vanilla CSS


## Browser support

- Chrome latest
- Firefox latest
- Opera latest
- Safari latest
- IE latest

The above list is non-exhaustive. Skeleton works perfectly with almost all older versions of the browsers above, though IE certainly has large degradation prior to IE9.
